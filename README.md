Sort the List and print the three descending values 

Given a list of countries as input, please sort the list in alphabetical order, then print out the first three values in descending order in the Output Panel. 

Note: Use this value for the List initialization: new List (of String) from {"Germany", "Spain", "Japan", "Brazil", "India", "China"}. 

Output: one entry in the Output panel containing a list with the three alphabetical descending items (“Spain, Japan, India”).
